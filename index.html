                MF Doom described Mm..Food as a concept album "about the things you find on a picnic, or at a picnic
                table".[1] The album's titles and lyrics contain references to different foods, some with common
                metaphors and double entendres in the "street world" and the "nutritional realm".
                The album is primarily produced by MF Doom, except for the tracks "Potholderz", produced by Count Bass
                D; "One Beer", produced by Madlib and originally intended for the joint Madlib and MF Doom album
                Madvillainy and "Kon Queso" produced by PNS of Molemen. Mm..Food features guest appearances from
                Count Bass D, Angelika, 4ize and Mr. Fantastik.

                Madvillainy is the only studio album by American hip hop duo Madvillain, consisting of rapper MF Doom
                and producer Madlib. It was released on March 23, 2004, on Stones Throw Records.

                The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Madlib created most of the instrumentals during a trip to
                Brazil in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a turntable, and a
                tape deck.[1] Fourteen months before the album was released, an unfinished demo version was stolen and
                leaked onto the internet. Frustrated, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after
                they had released other solo projects.
